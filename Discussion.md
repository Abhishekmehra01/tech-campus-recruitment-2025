Why This Approach?
1.Handles large files efficiently (Reads line-by-line, avoids storing unnecessary data in memory).
2. Optimized for speed (Simple substring match avoids complex regex parsing).
3. Minimal memory usage (Does not load the entire file into memory).
4. Portable and easy to use (Standard C++ with no external dependencies).
